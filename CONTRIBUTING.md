# Contributing to ByteGuard

Thanks for considering contributing to ByteGuard.

ByteGuard is an open-source initiative focused on practical application-security tooling. Contributions like bug reports, PRs, docs, tests, and feedback help keep the ecosystem useful and trustworthy.

These are lightweight guidelines for contributing to ByteGuard repositories hosted under the ByteGuard organization. This is a living document — improvements via PR are welcome.

## Where to start?

Each repository is the best place to contribute to its own scope:

- **Core libraries/packages**: changes and fixes belong in the relevant package repo.
- **Docs and examples**: improvements are always welcome (especially clarity and real-world usage).

If you’re new, look for issues labeled **good first issue**, **up-for-grabs**, or **help wanted** (if the repo uses them).

Before starting work on a PR, consider commenting on an existing issue or creating one so we can align on approach.

## Reporting an issue

Bugs and enhancements are tracked via GitHub Issues.

When creating an issue, please include:

- What you expected vs. what happened
- Steps to reproduce (a minimal sample helps a lot)
- Version(s) affected
- Environment details (OS/runtime/framework, where relevant)
- Logs/error output (please **redact secrets**)

## Requesting a feature/enhancement

Feature requests are also tracked via GitHub Issues.

Please include:

- The problem you’re trying to solve (use-case)
- Your proposed solution (API/behavior, if relevant)
- Alternatives you considered
- Any security implications or compatibility concerns

## Security vulnerabilities

**Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If the repo has **Security Advisories** enabled, report it there. Otherwise, use the security contact information listed in the repository (README/profile) if available.

Include:

- Description + impact
- Affected versions
- Repro steps / PoC (if safe to share)
- Suggested mitigation (if you have one)

## Making a PR

- If an issue does not already exist, please create one first (or explain the motivation clearly in the PR).
- Fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.
- Keep commits as logical units and reference the related issue when possible.
- Run build/tests locally before opening the PR.
- Prefer small, focused PRs over large multi-purpose changes.
- For behavior changes or fixes, tests are strongly encouraged.
